## Hi there 👋
This initiative arised because of prolonged inactivity of @GOG-Nebula account, which initially was made because of inactivity of @FriendsOfGalaxy account (see a pattern here? 😅), which used to manage and maintain unofficial integrations for GOG GALAXY 2.0.

## Goals
Since @GOG-Nebula , does not have a "proper" standard/padronization with their repo's, since it's 100% community managed, it can become a mess for some users that do not have that basic understanding of scripts.
Or those that only want to use the GOG plataform integrations, but just gives up, because of the complexity it can become, searching all the possible versions of integrations and latest releases, if there are any.*

**So, the main goals consist of:**
  * -[ ] Set a pattern for every repo.
  * -[ ] Set a pattern for every release version.
  * -[ ] Develop a easy to use GUI, to install all the available integrations.
  * -[ ] Become a source of secure plugins collection for GOG Galaxy.
  * -[ ] Improve knowledge base for script, plugin & integrations developers.


***DISCLAIMER**: *This project does not intend to "steal" or "make it better", than GOG Nebula. This is just a different approach. Every script, integration, update etc, that is "released" in this repo, and can be useful to any repo @GOG-Nebula , **will** have a pr there!
In the end, we are all the same community.*
